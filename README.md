This project pioneers a paradigm shift in biology education by leveraging cutting-edge Mixed Reality (MR) technology to transform the pedagogical landscape of studying flora and fauna in educational institutions. By seamlessly integrating Mixed Reality (MR) technology with a proprietary app, our initiative redefines the conventional dissection practices in schools and colleges. Emphasizing ethical, environmental, and educational dimensions, the project replaces live dissections with immersive MR experiences. Through our custom app, students engage in lifelike virtual dissections, enabling a comprehensive understanding of biological structures without ethical concerns or environmental impact. The innovation addresses student sensitivities, cultural variations, and legal regulations, fostering a more inclusive and sustainable educational approach. This pioneering solution not only aligns with contemporary ethical standards but also enhances the educational experience by leveraging cutting-edge technology. By incorporating mixed reality into the curriculum, the project promotes an environmentally conscious and ethically sound method for studying organisms, ensuring a progressive and responsible educational future.
